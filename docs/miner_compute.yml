# Compute Requirements for Miners
# This document outlines the recommended hardware specifications for running miners on your subnet.
# It provides a rough estimate to help users decide if their machine is suitable for running a miner or validator.

# Note: Specifications for miners may differ from those for validators.

version: '1.0'  # Update this version key as needed to match your release version.
